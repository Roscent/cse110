# In this lesson, you will learn how to solve more interesting
# problems using numeric data types.

#LIBRARIES
# YOU CAN INPORT CODE WRITTEN BY SOMEONE ELSE INTO YOUR PROGRAM SO YOU CAN USE IT
# SOME ARE ATOMATICALLY BUILT INTO PYTHON E.G MATHS, GRAPHICS AND LOADING DATA FROM THE INTERNET

# MATH PROGRAM : if we were working on a program that does some math
# buth needs more than just the standard operator we can use the math module
# that is included in the built in statndard library in order to have access to
# the code in the math module at the top of our program er can write the code IMPORT MATH

#ROUNDING A DECIMAL TO WHOLE NUMBER

"""import math

number = 5.12
round_up_number = math.ceil(number)
print(round_up_number)
print(math.pi)"""


# F-Strings
"""import math

number = 5.12
round_up_number = math.ceil(number)
