#FILES BASICS

# Text files are composed of characters, letters and symbols that we could
# Open up, look at or edit, other kind of files such as images, and music
# are stored in others ways that make them more difficult to work with

#TEXT FILES
# 1. Open an empty vc code window, open a folder where you can create a couple
# of files that we can use, 
# 2. Create a .py file in that folder that will be apython program, 
# 3. Create a second file in .txt that can store things you want to work on
# .py and .txt are text files, but by giving them extensions we are giving
# a hint in the operating system about what program it should use to open it
# If it sees a file with a .jpeg, or .jpg it assumes its a picture, if it sees
# if it sees a .docx it assumes its a microsoft word document. Files with a
# .py extension are python programs and files with a .txt extensions are
# just generic text files.
# In your txt file, type in what you want to type in there
