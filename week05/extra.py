# how do i change multiple lines of code to a comment at once in python


# ChatGPT said:
# In Python, you can turn multiple lines of code into comments using either of these methods:

# 1. Using # for each line (Preferred)
# Python does not have a built-in multi-line comment syntax like /* */ in C or <!-- --> in HTML. The conventional way is to add # at the beginning of each line:

# python
# Copy code
# # print("This is line 1")
# # print("This is line 2")
# # print("This is line 3")
# 2. Using Triple Quotes (""" or ''') (Not a real comment, but works)
# You can enclose multiple lines in triple quotes (""" or '''). This creates a multi-line string, which is ignored if not assigned to a variable:

# python
# Copy code
# """
# print("This is line 1")
# print("This is line 2")
# print("This is line 3")
# """
# âš  Warning: This is not a real comment; it is a string that doesn't get executed but still exists in memory.

# Quick Commenting in Editors
# VS Code: Select the lines and press Ctrl + / (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + / (Mac).

# PyCharm: Select the lines and press Ctrl + / (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + / (Mac).

# Jupyter Notebook: Select the lines and press Ctrl + /.
